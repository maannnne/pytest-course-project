# PyTest Course Project



## How to run me from the main directory :)

- All tests, use command ```pytest```,
- The tests with a specific mark, use command ```pytest -m markerName```,
- And generate html reports, use command ```pytest --html="/tests/reports/result.html"```,
- And generate xml reports, use command ```pytest --junitxml="/tests/reports/result.xml"```
- Using verbose mode on a specific environment (custom) ```pytest --env dev -v```
